TWICE in the whole book. It is a cute book but not really funny nor usefull in aa[16;1Hnyway...unless your 18 then you might get away with some of the stunts in here.  [17;1HI think I found 3 fairly good tips other than that I was done with the book in uu[18;1Hnder an hour and can't wait to get rid of it.
I bought this book after seeing a review in a magazine and I didn't put it down  [20;1Huntil I'd finished it. The author offers a fresh perspective and crazy tips on hh[21;1How to be the best and badest girl. I cried from laughter and then went out and bb[22;1Hought 3 copies to give to my best female friends. Another book that I found intee[23;1Hnse was &quot;He Never Called Again&quot;.

This book was incredibly spontaneous. It makes you laugh like crazy and you can  [12;1Hactually take most of the advice given. No, the advice isn't spiritual or what ii[13;1Ht takes to be a woman.. it's just a lot of fun and it helps you bring the goodnee[14;1Hss and childhood out of you. You responsibly decide what advice you'd prefer to  [15;1Htake [though A LOT tend to be very jokeful, and not actually serious]. It's a cuu[16;1Hte book you can read if you just need a getaway from actually being responsible  [17;1Hand serious 24/7.
Belleluv had it right. Hilarious if you get and enjoy Cameron Tuttle's sense of  [19;1Hhumor. This book never fails to make me laugh.<BR>Just the chapter on being bad  [20;1Hat work alone is worth its price.<BR>Just thinking of doing some of these thingss[21;1H to my boss makes the stress melt away.<BR>Every girl whether she acts on it or  [22;1Hnot.

It's great little book for laughs- with a good message that we forget- to have ff[22;1Hun and make our own rules- So, some of the advice is ridiculous, but so what?

Okay, so some of the suggestions are a little crazy and would never work in the  [21;1Hreal world.  Then again, no one reads Spiderman comic and decides to try to spinn[22;1H spider webs.

I picked this book up in Vegas at the Hard Rock gift shop.  I was a on trip therr[18;1He with my best girlfriend.  We had a blast reading this book together and sharinn[19;1Hg secrets.  The best chapter is how to get your bartenders attention.  We'd triee[20;1Hd a few of the lines out in Vegas and they worked real well.  This book is more  [21;1Hfun to share than to read by yourself.
Borrowed this from a friend and couldn't put it down.  'Are you a bad girl' quizz[23;1H was probably the funniest part of this book.

This is definitely a book that would be fun to take literally. Cameron Tuttle's  [17;1Hwriting style is very unique and very hilarious... this book has changed my opinn[18;1Hion on a lot of things, and has made me see things in a brighter light. The bookk[19;1H makes you get a grip of yourself and get a life. It is honestly my bible. Even  [20;1Hmy boyfriend loved it - he wouldn't give it back to me till he was done going thh[21;1Hrough all the &quot;men&quot; sections, which we both found hilarious. If you doo[22;1Hn't choose to take the book entirely seriously, then buy it for the sake of a goo[23;1Hod laugh. Either way, this book will change your life - maybe only slightly - bu[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                             [m[24;63H[K[24;63H19,1[10C24%[6;1H[?25h[?25l[24;53H~@k[6;1H[24;53H   [11;1H[24;63H20[11;1H[?25h[?25l[24;53Hq[11;1H[?25h[?25l[24;54H:[11;1H[24;53H  [11;1H[24;63H[K[24;1H:[?2004h[1;1HI picked this book up in Vegas at the Hard Rock gift shop.
